Today I researched the advantages and disadvantages of UART to get more context of its benefits for our project. 

Benefits of UART
- Can travel across distances up to 50 feet (perfect for us as we plan on using a maximum length of 10 m for our wires).
- Each device uses its own independent clock cycle. 
- Perfect for use with our 2x5 pin header
- Has a variety of applications and uses and is common in most appliances. 

Disadvantages of UART
- Only suitable for connections between two devices (This is ideal for us as all of our connections will be between appliances and central hub).
- Not able to interface with computer as computer does not have port for UART.

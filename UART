Benefits of UART
- Can travel across distances up to 50 feet (perfect for us as we plan on using a maximum length of 10 m for our wires).
- Each device uses its own independent clock cycle. 
- Perfect for use with our 2x5 pin header

Disadvantages of UART
- Only suitable for connections between two devices (This is ideal for us as all of our connections will be between appliances and central hub).

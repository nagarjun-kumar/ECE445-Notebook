What I worked on : Today I did some research on various temperature sensors available on digikey. These notes are specifically on the MCP9804 temperature sensor. 

- Predicts temperature accurately from -40 to 125 degrees Celsius. Although there are not many verifications that we need to pass for the temperature sensor, it is 
best to have proper accuracy for a wide range of temperatures. 

- Min Voltage 2.7 V 
- Max voltage 5 V
- operating current 200 uA
- 2 wire interface : I2C compatible

What I did today: 
- Worked on creating circuit schematics for thermostat.
- Essential parts of thermostat schematics were the GPIO headers, ATMEGA328P microcontroller (Arduino), MCP9804 temperature sensor.
- 3 Relays added to design for future implementation of HVAC system to actually change the temperature.
- 3 LEDs added to display various settings on thermostat (heat, AC, fan). 
- GPIO headers used for UART interface with central hub. 
- After schematics were complete, designed PCB on PCBWay. 
- When designing PCB, it is essential to keep in mind placement on different parts and using as minimal length wiring as possible. 
- Also important to make use of back of the board to free up space.

What to do:
- Next immediate work will be on soldering the thermostat.

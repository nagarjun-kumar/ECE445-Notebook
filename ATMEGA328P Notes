What I did today: Studied various essentials needed to power and use ATMEGA328P chip. 

Essential components:
- A breadboard
- 22 AWG wire
- 7805 Voltage regulator
- 2 LEDs
- 2 220 Ohm resistors
- 1 10k Ohm resistor
- 2 10 uF capacitors
- 16 MHz clock crystal
- 2 22 pF capacitors

All of these components are present in our earlier submitted PCB designs containing the ATMEGA328P chip i.e. all appliances. 

- Best way to read and write data coming from our sensors is to read it serially using the Wire.h library. 
- Data can be read through serial monitor present on Arduino IDE. 
- Once code has been written for each microcontroller, bootload it onto the chip to be able to run the code.

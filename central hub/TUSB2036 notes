- Today, I did research on various USB 2.0 Hub chips that would fit best with our design for the central hub. 
- Below is key information I have found about TUSB2036 USB 2.0 hub. 

- Total number of pins : 32
- Minimum voltage is 3 V and max voltage is 3.6 V
- 3 port USB hub


This is ideal for us as we are only planning on creating 3 appliances for this project. However, it may not be ideal for our final design as we plan to have as many
as 7 appliances connected to one central hub. This is to maximize the amount of appliances we can have without having to daisy chain central hubs together. Will 
need to do more research to find USB hub with more ports than this one.

What I worked on: Today I worked on finding the best sensor to use to track motion. Compared the pros and cons of PIR sensor. 

Benefits of PIR sensor
- Detects motion relatively well indoors as well as during day and night time.
- Consumes approxiametly 0.8 - 1.0 W which is much less than microwave sensor
- Cheaper and more useful for electronic appliances that are compact. 

Disadvantages of PIR sensor
- Have lower sensitivity so need to account for noise.
- Does not operate in temperatures greater than 35 Celsius.
- Only works effectively in line of sight and has issues sensing corners of view.
- Insensitive to very slow moving objects.

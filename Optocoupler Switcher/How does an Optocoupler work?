Things I did today: Researched how a optocoupler switcher works. Here are some notes on my findings. 

- An optocoupler is a semiconductor device that allows an electrical signal to be transmitted between two isolated circuits.
- Two parts are used in an optocoupler: an LED that emits infrared light and a photosensitive device that detects light from the LED. 
- The input circuit takes the incoming signal, determines if it is AC or DC and then uses this signal to turn on the LED. 
- There are four configurations of optocoupler switchers: 
- Photo-transistor - DC
- Photo-Darlington - DC
- Photo-SCR - AC
- Photo-TRIAC - AC

- The main difference between these four configurations is the photosensitive device being used.

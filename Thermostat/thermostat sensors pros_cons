Resistance Temperature Detector (RTD) :
RTD is based on the change is resistance of any metal. RTD sensor is based on the change in resistance that metal
undergoes when going through temperature change, rather than the actual change in temperature.

Platinum RTD are often used as they provide a near linear response to temperature changes. They are often used for precise
temperature calculations. 

Thermistors :
Rely on same resistance change in metals as temperature changes. They are cheaper but often times less accurate than
RTD counterpart. 

Semiconductor based ICs :
Come in two types: local and remote
Local temperature sensors measure their own die temperature using the physical properties of their transistor. 
Remote temperature sensors measure the temperature of an external transistor. 

For our project we are using a Code type E temperature sensor as it will provide most accurate results due to its higher sensitivity.

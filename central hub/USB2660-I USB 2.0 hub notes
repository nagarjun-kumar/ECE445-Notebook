Today i continued my research on various USB 2.0 Hub chips

- Data Rate: 480 Mb/s
- Min operating temp -40 degrees Celsius to max operating temp of 85 degrees Celsius. 
- 7 port USB hub, allowing us to stack more appliances onto it. 
- Min voltage : 3 V max voltage : 3.6 V

This USB 2.0 hub is much more useful than the previous one i examined as this one has more ports, allowing for the customer to use more appliances
without stacking central hubs onto each other.

Things I did: 
- Soldered all components of thermostat. 
- Some components were much harder to solder such as the MCP9804 temperature sensor as pins were extremely small. 
- Thermostat was fully functional and all buttons and LEDs were able to display after first iteration of soldering. 
- Ran into issues soldering some of the smaller capacitors and resistors as well but with help of Peter, was able to get these soldered on too.
